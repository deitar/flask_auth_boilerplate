# Flask Authentication Boilerplate

This repository contains a simple Flask authentication boilerplate, which includes user registration, login, logout, and profile views. The application uses Flask-SQLAlchemy for database operations and Flask-Login for managing user sessions.

## Features

- User registration with basic validation.
- Password hashing for secure storage.
- User login with email and password.
- Persistent user sessions with the option to remember the user for an extended period (365 days).
- Logout functionality to clear the user session.
- Protected profile page accessible only to authenticated users.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Flask-Login
- Werkzeug

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/deitar/flask_auth_boilerplate.git`

2. Install the required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Configure the application:

Update the `app_config.py` file with your configuration settings, such as the database URL and the secret key.

4. Start the application:

`python app.py`

The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

1. Register: Visit the registration page (`/register`) and fill in the required fields to create a new user account. Upon successful registration, you will be redirected to the login page.

2. Login: Visit the login page (`/login`) and enter your registered email and password to log in. You can choose to remember your login session for 365 days.

3. Profile: After logging in, you can access the protected profile page (`/profile`) that displays a personalized welcome message.

4. Logout: Click on the "Logout" link on the profile page to end your session and log out of the application.

## Customize

You can customize this boilerplate to suit your specific needs. Some potential improvements include:

- Adding email confirmation during user registration.
- Implementing password recovery functionality.
- Enhancing user validation and error handling.
- Using a real database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) instead of SQLite for production.

## Security Considerations

This boilerplate provides basic authentication features but should not be considered production-ready without further security enhancements. When deploying a production application, consider implementing additional security measures such as:

- Using secure password hashing with salting.
- Protecting against SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.
- Enabling HTTPS to secure data transmission.
- Implementing CSRF protection to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
- Regularly updating packages and dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
